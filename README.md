# testmonths

Using case statement. BASH scripting exercise.

Task

Write a script that takes as an argument a month in numerical form (i.e. between 1 and 12), and translates this to the month name and displays the result on standard out (the terminal).

If no argument is given, or a bad number is given, the script should report the error and exit.
